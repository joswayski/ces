## Download Captures Preview

These links always download the **latest** validated Preview:

| Platform | Download |
| --- | --- |
| macOS 13+ (Apple silicon) | [Captures-macOS-Apple-Silicon.dmg](https://github.com/joswayski/captures/releases/download/preview/Captures-macOS-Apple-Silicon.dmg) |
| Windows 11 (x64) | [Captures-Windows-x64-setup.exe](https://github.com/joswayski/captures/releases/download/preview/Captures-Windows-x64-setup.exe) |
| Ubuntu / Debian (x64) | [Captures-Linux-x64.deb](https://github.com/joswayski/captures/releases/download/preview/Captures-Linux-x64.deb) |
| Other Linux (x64 AppImage) | [Captures-Linux-x64.AppImage](https://github.com/joswayski/captures/releases/download/preview/Captures-Linux-x64.AppImage) |

Preview builds automatically publish installed-app changes from `main`, and may contain bugs or incomplete features. Changes arriving during a build are grouped into the next Preview instead of waiting for an installer for every merge. Installed copies check captur.es for a new Preview shortly after launch and about every five minutes; the site caches GitHub's updater note so those checks stay off GitHub. The notice lists every Preview published since the version you have, then installs the latest. Turn **Show what’s new on update notices** off in Preferences for a compact Update now prompt. Installing still downloads the signed archive from GitHub and closes open captures; unsaved edits are kept as drafts and stay in Capture History. The update notice stays on screen during a capture so you can screenshot the changelog or an error. GitHub 403s are often a short rate limit, and Try again usually works. If the download is missing (404), use **download from captur.es** on the error, or the installer links above. You can also check from Preferences → Updates, or the tray **Check for Updates…** item. If Captures will not open or cannot install an update, download the installer for your OS from the table above. The macOS disk image, Windows setup, and Debian package replace the installed app. For the AppImage, copy it over `~/.local/bin/Captures.AppImage` and make it executable (`chmod +x`); running it from Downloads starts a second copy. Settings, capture history, and OS permissions stay. Older dated builds stay in the [build archive](https://github.com/joswayski/captures/releases).

## Features

- Capture regions, windows, or full displays. Window mode treats the menu bar, taskbar, and desktop backdrop as a full-display capture instead of a window.
- Draw a region from an empty screen (no pre-sized outline); lock to common aspect ratios, or hold Shift for a square
- Press Enter in the capture menu to confirm a screenshot or recording once a target is ready
- Optional auto-start after selecting a region, window, or full display (Preferences). Draw a region, click a window, or click the desktop in Full screen mode to start; with auto-start off, confirm with Enter or the capture button
- Optional freeze while choosing a region or window, so hover states, tooltips, menus, and motion stay put (on by default; turn off in Preferences to select from the live desktop)
- On macOS, frozen display previews and region/display screenshots convert the display color profile to sRGB; colors outside the sRGB gamut remain limited by the current capture pipeline.
- Optional cursor in screenshots (on by default; freeze screen does not include the pointer by itself)
- Optional countdown before screenshots and recordings
- Region recordings keep the selected area highlighted on screen while recording
- Record as H.264 MP4, with desktop audio and microphone. Save or export as MP4, GIF, or WebM
- Pause, resume, restart, and mute while recording
- On macOS and Windows, recording controls stay out of screenshots and recordings by default (Preferences). On Linux, use Hide controls during a recording to keep the bar off-screen
- Cursor and click highlights in recordings (where supported)
- Built-in screenshot editor — text, shapes, images, and drawings can rotate from a shared handle (hold Shift to use a configurable snap increment); text and drawings with optional drop shadows (color, opacity, blur, and offset; the whole label, including a background plate), crop (drag from outside the canvas to reach an edge; hold Shift to lock aspect), layers that hang off the canvas stay clipped until you expand, erase to transparent; unsaved edits restore when you reopen
- Trim, crop, resize, and adjust audio in recordings, with an estimated saved size and an in-editor before/after compression comparison (Hide on the overlay, or switch back to Preserve quality)
- Default screenshot save format PNG, JPEG, or WebP (Capture History stays lossless PNG until you save); export with Tiny through Highest quality presets and an in-editor before/after comparison while Export settings are open. Hide the comparison or close Export settings to edit without the slider; save quality stays Compress or Maximum until you change it
- Mini previews for quick copy, save, and drag into other apps. Minimize the stack into a corner pile when it covers the desktop; click the pile to expand it, drag the pile to move it out of the way, and a new capture shows the pile again if capture hid it. Choose a default screen corner in Preferences (bottom left unless you change it). Near the top of the screen the pile fans and opens downward, with Show less on that edge; near the bottom it fans and opens up. On the right, Show less sits on the right of the stack so it stays on the screen edge. With two or more expanded previews, Clear all dismisses the stack; saved files and Capture History stay
- Screenshots during an active recording
- 30-day capture history, filtered by screenshots, video, or GIF
- Light, dark, or system appearance across every Captures window
- Customizable shortcuts and accent colors. Find a setting in Preferences with `Cmd`+`F` on macOS or `Ctrl`+`F` on Windows and Linux
- Capture UI and capture actions stay disabled while the desktop session is locked or inactive
- Optional in-app feedback (never includes your captures)
- After an unexpected quit, Preview may send a crash diagnostic (app version, OS, and a redacted panic or OS crash summary) through the same feedback channel; it never includes captures or home-directory paths. A normal logoff or shutdown is not a crash.

## Optional cloud accounts — in development

Local screenshots, GIFs, and recordings never require an account. The website
includes an optional account foundation at `/account`, using WorkOS email
one-time codes when configured by the operator. Captures stores an internal
account mapping and email/verification state in PostgreSQL; WorkOS manages login
and authentication sessions. No captures are uploaded by signing in. Hosted
uploads, sharing, Google login, and desktop sign-in are not implemented yet.

## Wishlist

- Scrolling capture for content larger than the screen
- On-device text recognition (OCR)
- Repeat the previous capture area
- Pinned captures that stay above other windows
- Editable click highlights and keystroke overlays after recording
- Hosted sharing with shareable `captur.es/<id>` links
- Faster recording on Windows and Linux

## Platform status

| Platform | Status |
| --- | --- |
| macOS 13+ | Supported; primary development target |
| Windows 11 | Supported; experimental |
| Linux X11 | Supported; hide recording controls manually when needed |
| Linux Wayland | Experimental; no window targeting, cursor capture, or click highlights. Mini previews cannot poll the pointer, so the stack stays interactive and may cover apps underneath |

## Shortcuts

Defaults follow each platform’s built-in screenshot keys. Captures-only actions keep extra shortcuts.

### macOS

| Default shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Cmd`+`Shift`+`Space` | Open New Capture |
| `Cmd`+`Shift`+`4` | Capture a region |
| `Cmd`+`Shift`+`W` | Capture a window |
| `Cmd`+`Shift`+`3` | Choose a display for a full-screen screenshot |
| `Cmd`+`Shift`+`5` | Record a region |
| `Cmd`+`Shift`+`Option`+`W` | Record a window |
| `Cmd`+`Shift`+`Option`+`3` | Choose a display to record full screen |
| `Esc` | Cancel an active capture, screenshot countdown, or recording countdown |

### Windows

| Default shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`Space` | Open New Capture |
| `Win`+`Shift`+`S` | Capture a region |
| `Alt`+`PrtScn` | Capture a window |
| `PrtScn` | Choose a display for a full-screen screenshot |
| `Win`+`Alt`+`R` | Record a region |
| `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`Alt`+`W` | Record a window |
| `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`Alt`+`3` | Choose a display to record full screen |
| `Esc` | Cancel an active capture, screenshot countdown, or recording countdown |

### Linux (GNOME / Ubuntu)

| Default shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `PrtScn` | Open New Capture |
| `Super`+`Shift`+`S` | Capture a region |
| `Alt`+`PrtScn` | Capture a window |
| `Shift`+`PrtScn` | Choose a display for a full-screen screenshot |
| `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`Alt`+`R` | Record a region |
| `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`Alt`+`W` | Record a window |
| `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`Alt`+`3` | Choose a display to record full screen |
| `Esc` | Cancel an active capture, screenshot countdown, or recording countdown |

Global capture shortcuts can be changed in Preferences. In Preferences, `Cmd`+`F` on macOS or `Ctrl`+`F` on Windows and Linux finds a setting; `Enter`, `F3`, or `Cmd`/`Ctrl`+`G` moves to the next match. Installations still on earlier factory defaults (`Ctrl`+`Shift` or the shared macOS-style number keys) are updated automatically; custom shortcuts stay as they are.

On macOS, overlapping Screenshot app shortcuts (`Cmd`+`Shift`+`3` / `4` / `5`) are unbound immediately so those keys reach Captures instead of the system overlay; restore them in System Settings → Keyboard → Keyboard Shortcuts → Screenshots if you want both. On GNOME, overlapping screenshot keybindings are cleared when `gsettings` is available; on KDE, Spectacle’s rectangular-region shortcut is cleared when `kwriteconfig` is available. On Windows, Print Screen is turned off for Snipping Tool when Captures uses that key, and `Win`+`Shift`+`S` is intercepted so Snipping Tool does not open. If another screenshot tool still opens on the same shortcut, `Esc` always cancels Captures — even when that other overlay has keyboard focus or the freeze-frame has not finished painting. Captures lives in the menu bar or tray after setup (on Windows, look in the taskbar overflow if the icon is hidden). Open Captures from Start, Search, or the app icon to show Preferences, including Capture History. Capture from a shortcut, the tray **New Capture** item, or a tray capture action. If a capture starts while Start or Search is still open, Captures waits for those flyouts to close so they are not frozen into the screenshot.

While New Capture is open, the region, window, and display screenshot or recording shortcuts switch that overlay in place. They do not dismiss the menu or bring Preferences and other windows forward. Press the same screenshot shortcut again to freeze the capture menu into the next snapshot. An already-open region or window overlay does the same: the shortcut freezes that overlay instead of tearing it down, so you can capture Captures with Captures.

While selecting a capture region, pick an aspect ratio in the capture menu or hold
`Shift` for a square. In the screenshot editor, zoom with the header slider and
`+`/`-` controls, pinch or `Ctrl`/`Cmd`+scroll, pan with `Ctrl`/`Cmd`-drag or
middle-click, hold `Shift` while dragging a corner handle to scale
proportionally, and duplicate layers with `Ctrl`/`Cmd`+`D`. Header W×H resizes
the canvas. Hover a layer that hangs off an edge to preview the clipped part
and expand. Locked layers keep size and position until unlocked; layer width
and height stay proportional.
