# Developing Captures

This guide covers local setup, validation, and packaging. Maintainer release procedures live in [docs/releases.md](docs/releases.md), and bundled media details live in [docs/media-sidecars.md](docs/media-sidecars.md).

## Requirements

- Rust 1.94 with `rustfmt` and `clippy`
- Node.js 24 and npm 11
- macOS: macOS 26 SDK
- Windows: Visual Studio C++ build tools, Windows 11 SDK, and MSYS2/MinGW
- Linux: PipeWire and ALSA development packages

On Debian or Ubuntu, install `libpipewire-0.3-dev`, `libspa-0.2-dev`, and `libasound2-dev`.

The optional Rust account API also needs PostgreSQL for database integration
tests. It does not participate in local desktop capture. See
[`apps/api/README.md`](apps/api/README.md) for configuration, schema isolation,
migrations and tests, and [`apps/web/README.md`](apps/web/README.md#optional-accounts)
for the account placeholder. Sign-in is unavailable. `npm run check` verifies
that account requests fail closed and the built public website still works.
The offline deployment-notification tests also require Bash and `jq` on PATH
(including on Windows); they intercept HTTP calls and send no Discord messages.

## Setup

```sh
npm install
npm run prepare:media
npm run dev
```

`npm run prepare:media` is required on the first run for each operating system and whenever the pinned media build changes. It downloads the pinned FFmpeg source from ffmpeg.org, or from a previously published Preview if that host is unreachable.

## Design harness

Every Captures window is a `?view=` route on one SPA. `npm run dev --workspace @captures/desktop`
serves that SPA on `http://127.0.0.1:1420` without Tauri, and adding `?mock` installs a
mocked backend with representative sample data so any window can be reviewed in a browser:

```sh
npm run dev --workspace @captures/desktop
open "http://127.0.0.1:1420/?view=preferences&mock=1"
open "http://127.0.0.1:1420/?view=recording-hud&mock=1&stage=1"
open "http://127.0.0.1:1420/?view=recording-hud&mock=1&stage=1&controls=1"
open "http://127.0.0.1:1420/?view=recording-region-indicator&mock=1&stage=1&target=region&x=260&y=180&width=1000&height=640"
open "http://127.0.0.1:1420/?view=thumbnail&mock=1&stage=1"
open "http://127.0.0.1:1420/?view=thumbnail&mock=1&stage=1&placement=top-right"
open "http://127.0.0.1:1420/?view=thumbnail&mock=1&stage=1&reject=1"
open "http://127.0.0.1:1420/?view=update&mock=1"
open "http://127.0.0.1:1420/?view=update&mock=1&captures=1"
open "http://127.0.0.1:1420/?view=update&mock=1&changelog=0"
open "http://127.0.0.1:1420/?view=update&mock=1&update=downloading"
open "http://127.0.0.1:1420/?view=update&mock=1&update=restarting"
open "http://127.0.0.1:1420/?view=update&mock=1&update=error"
open "http://127.0.0.1:1420/?view=startup&mock=1"
open "http://127.0.0.1:1420/?view=startup&mock=1&stage=1&caret=top&caret_x=148"
```

- `mock` installs the sample backend (`apps/desktop/ui/src/dev/previewBackend.ts`).
- `stage` paints a sample desktop behind transparent overlay windows.
- Other parameters set variants: `mode`, `target`, `state`, `update`, `platform`, `granted`, `drafts`, `captures`, `count`, `placement`, `changelog`, `reject`.
- `changelog=0` hides stacked release notes on the update notice (Preferences default is on).
- `caret=top` or `caret=bottom` plus `caret_x` places the tray-pointing triangle on the update and launch notices.
- `placement` sets the mini-preview home corner in the thumbnail and Preferences harness (`top-left`, `top-right`, `bottom-left`, `bottom-right`).
- `reject=1` loops the mini-preview self-drop “no” shake on the newest expanded card.
- `auto=1` enables automatic capture in the selector harness so its compact controls and Preferences link can be reviewed.
- `controls=1` includes recording controls in captures so the will-show copy and Preferences link can be reviewed. Combine with `platform=linux` to review the capture-menu copy that cannot open that setting.
- `live=1` or `frozen=0` shows the capture overlay and recording selector over the live desktop instead of a freeze-frame.
- `screenshot_format` and `video_format` set the Preferences defaults used by the editor harness (`png`/`jpeg`/`webp` and `mp4`/`gif`/`webm`).
- `platform` selects macOS, Windows, or Linux shortcut defaults and copy in the Preferences harness (`?view=preferences&mock=1&platform=windows`). On Linux it also disables recording-control exclusion.
- Appearance follows the `captures-appearance` value in `localStorage`.

The harness is dev-only and is dropped from production builds. Drop an optional
`apps/desktop/ui/public/dev-sample.mp4` (git-ignored) to review the recording editor
with a real clip.

## Design system

Tokens live in `shared/design.css` (neutral ramp, semantic surfaces, spacing, radii,
elevation, motion) and `shared/themes.css` (accent and signal palettes). The desktop
stylesheet is `apps/desktop/ui/src/styles.css`, which imports those tokens plus one
module per family of surfaces from `apps/desktop/ui/src/styles/`.

- Regular windows follow the light/dark/system appearance setting.
- Surfaces that float over the desktop — capture overlay, capture menu, recording
  controls, mini previews, saved/hidden recording notices, the post-update / launch
  tooltip — use the fixed `--glass-*` media palette so they stay legible on any
  wallpaper.
- The update notice is a solid `--surface-raised` card in a transparent native
  window. The launch notice is a dark glass pill with a CSS triangle caret pointing
  at the tray or menu bar icon, not a rotated square.
- Accent is reserved for the primary capture action, selection, and focus. Status
  colors keep stable meanings: signal for recording and destructive, green for saved,
  blue for progress.

## Validation

Run the default repository gate:

```sh
npm run check
```

For Rust changes, also run:

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo check --workspace --all-targets
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

## Packaging

Build Captures on the operating system where the package will run:

```sh
npm run build
```

Packages are written under `target/release/bundle`. On macOS, the default build also replaces `/Applications/Captures.app` and launches it. Use that Applications copy from Spotlight or Raycast. Checkout bundles in `target/` and Git worktrees are the same app name, so packaging excludes `target/` from Spotlight and moves the leftover `.app` to `target/release/bundle/macos.noindex` after install.

Useful macOS options:

```sh
# Build without installing
CAPTURES_SKIP_INSTALL=1 npm run build

# Install without launching
CAPTURES_OPEN_AFTER_INSTALL=0 npm run build

# Also reset Screen Recording permission
CAPTURES_RESET_PERMISSIONS=1 npm run build
```

macOS `npm run build` uses an installed Apple Development signing identity when available and otherwise uses an ad-hoc signature. Those builds omit updater artifacts unless `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` is provided. They also skip Apple notarization and strip quarantine on install, so they are a different Screen Recording identity and a different Gatekeeper path than a downloaded Preview. The bundle includes the Hardened Runtime `audio-input` entitlement so macOS can list Captures in Microphone settings after the app asks.

To iterate on first-run setup against the same Developer ID signature, notarized DMG, and Gatekeeper quarantine a user gets, use the local signed build:

```sh
# One-time: store the App Store Connect API key you already backed up for CI
npm run build:signed -- --setup --key ~/AuthKey_XXXXXXXXXX.p8 --key-id XXXXXXXXXX --issuer <issuer-id>

# Each iteration: sign, notarize, staple, install from the DMG, reset setup
npm run build:signed
```

The Developer ID Application identity name (`Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)`) is not a secret. `codesign` prints it on every shipped app. The `.p12` private key, its password, and the App Store Connect `.p8` are secrets; `--setup` stores the API key in `~/.captures` and a `captures-notary` keychain profile. GitHub will not give the `release` environment secrets back.

`npm run build:signed` requires macOS and that Developer ID identity in the login keychain. It resets the onboarding flag and Screen Recording / Microphone grants unless you pass `--keep-onboarding` or `--keep-permissions`. Notarization talks to Apple and usually takes a few minutes. It still does not publish a Preview, produce Windows or Linux installers, or exercise the in-app updater.

Useful options:

```sh
npm run build:signed -- --dry-run
npm run build:signed -- --no-launch
npm run build:signed -- --fresh-settings
npm run build:signed -- --skip-notarize
```

Windows builds produce an NSIS installer, MSI package, and unpackaged executable under `target/release`. Linux builds produce AppImage and Debian packages.

## Platform architecture

- macOS recording uses ScreenCaptureKit and VideoToolbox.
- Windows and Linux recording use `xcap` and OpenH264.
- Bundled FFmpeg sidecars handle media synchronization, editing, and GIF conversion.

## Feedback API

Early user feedback is posted to Discord with no database. Same-origin `/api/*`
routes are TanStack Start server routes under `apps/web/src/routes/api`.

To run the website and its API locally, create `apps/web/.env` with:

```dotenv
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...
```

Then run:

```sh
npm run dev:web
```

The local health endpoint is `http://localhost:5174/api/health`. The Preview
updater manifest cache is `GET http://localhost:5174/api/updates/preview`. See
[`apps/web/README.md`](apps/web/README.md) for AWS and Cloudflare setup.

Point a local desktop build at that server:

```sh
export CAPTURES_FEEDBACK_URL=http://localhost:5174/api/feedback
npm run dev
```

Packaged builds default to `https://captur.es/api/feedback`.
